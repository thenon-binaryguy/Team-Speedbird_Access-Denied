This is an intro as to how the machine learning is used in this project

The human recognition model uses a previously trained tensorflow model .
The architecture of the model is based on the Faster RCNN algorithm, which is an efficient and popular object detection algorithm which uses deep convolutional networks.
The Tensorflow model can also detect upto 90 objects at a time.

Instructions to run 
1. Download the human_detecor.py , the test data image and the rcnb module
2. Also download the trianed model from the link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-q-6tTYgT8ZWrT0zx-ClM7jbnyYfCP7Z/view?usp=sharing
3.store under the same file and run the python file
